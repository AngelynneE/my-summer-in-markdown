# **Introduction**
My name is Angelynne Elvambuena, I am a 12th grader at Chatsworth Charter High School. I love drawing and plan to go to a four year university to get a bachelor degree of fine arts.
# **New Skills Learned**
Over the summer, I managed to raise my baking skills! I made Churro Cheesecake and Strawberry Shortcake over my summer vacation.
# **Favorite Summer Food**
My favorite food this summer has been between two different things. First off, watermelon! My favorite classic summer treat. Secondly, 99% cooked ground beef with seasoned salt. It's very good and easy to make, as well as a nice source of protein to snack on.
